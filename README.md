# Project: Sign Language Recognition Using Deep Learning

Motivation: Actually the main motive behind this project is that I should not feel helpless when I come across a person who is deaf or dumb and he/she tries to say something to me. I understand research is already going and a lot of people are creating such things but at present I do not have any app in my phone which I can use at that time when I came across someone who communicate using only sign language.

## Initial Commit: 
- We are starting this project with a dataset of single images in each label eg. 1, 2, A, etc.
- Also the ppt is blank or it is just the template provided.

## DataSet Creation
- After capturing more images and applying data augmentaion, the total dataset now contains more than 10,000 images
